# Bear Cloud API

## Introduction
Welcome to the Bear's **Cloud** respository. This repository contains:
- Protocol Buffers (`.proto` files) defining the API specifications.
- Documentation for integrating and using the Cloud API service. 

The Bear Cloud API service is a gRPC-based API for third parties to:
- **Send commands** to control the robots,
- **Receive status updates** from robots, such as mission and battery status. 
- **Retrieve robot information**.

For a comprehensive overview of the API capabilities, refer to the **Public Cloud API** documentation website. While currently using gRPC, future plans include adding corresponding REST APIs.

## Overview
The Bear Base API facilitates communication between third-party clients and robots via the gRPC framework. It employs:
- **Unary RPC**: For request/response-type communications.
- **Server-streaming RPC**: For continuous updates from robots.

### Key Features of Server-streaming RPCs
1. **Metadata for Responses**:
   - Each response contains:
     - A **timestamp**: Indicates when the response was generated (local clock-based, not a global clock).
     - A **sequence number**: Incremental for ordering responses and detecting duplicates.
   - Note: Sequence numbers may reset to `0` under rare circumstances, such as service restarts.

2. **Handling Streaming Queries**:
   - Queries have a **60-minute timeout**. If needed beyond this duration, reissue the query.
   - **Message delivery guarantees**: "Best effort," meaning messages may be dropped due to:
     - Packet loss.
     - Network congestion.
     - Processing errors.
   - **Duplicate messages**: Clients must handle duplicates appropriately, considering both sequence numbers and timestamps for strict detection.

3. **gRPC Status Codes**:
   - A successful call returns an **OK** status with the expected response.
   - Errors result in a gRPC status code and an error message for debugging.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **gRPC Framework**: Ensure your development environment supports gRPC.
- **Protocol Buffers Compiler**: Install `protoc` for compiling `.proto` files into your desired language.
